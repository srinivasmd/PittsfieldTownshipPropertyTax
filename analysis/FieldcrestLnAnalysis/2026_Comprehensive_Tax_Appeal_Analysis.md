## Executive Summary

Analysis of **three years of Pittsfield Township assessment data** (2024-2026) — including the Residential Sales Analysis, ECF Analysis, and Land Analysis — conclusively demonstrates that the 2026 assessment for 3543 Fieldcrest Ln in the University Palisades subdivision (UNF) **overstates market value**. The implied True Cash Value of **$506,854** exceeds every single arm's-length sale ever recorded in the entire subdivision. The township's own ECF data shows individual Fieldcrest Ln properties with ECFs as low as **0.852**, meaning the cost approach overvalues some homes by nearly 15%.

**For 3543 Fieldcrest Ln specifically:**
- 2026 SEV: **$253,427** → Implied TCV: **$506,854**
- Assessed Value: **$253,427**
- Taxable Value: **$201,370**
- The implied TCV of $506,854 is **$36,854 above the highest sale ever** in University Palisades ($470,000)
- The five Fieldcrest Ln arm's-length comparables average **$445,800** (median $440,000)
- Recommended TCV: **$430,000–$455,000** (SEV: $215,000–$227,500)
- Potential reduction: **$25,927–$38,427** in assessed value

## 1. The Township's ECF Data for University Palisades

The **Economic Condition Factor (ECF)** is the township's own metric comparing actual arm's-length sale prices to cost-approach valuations. An ECF below 1.0 means the cost approach *overvalues* properties; above 1.0 means it *undervalues* them.

### UNF ECF Trend (3-Year)

| Year | Ave. ECF | What It Means |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **2024** | **N/A** | UNF not included in 2024 ECF summaries |
| **2025** | **0.974** | Cost values exceed market by **2.6%** on average |
| **2026** | **1.016** | Cost values roughly match market (+1.6%) |

The average ECF near 1.0 suggests the township's cost approach is *generally* calibrated for this subdivision. However, averages mask significant variation among individual properties.

### ECF Per Individual Property (UNF) — 2025 Data

- **8 of 13 properties** (62%) have ECFs below 1.0, meaning the cost approach overvalues them
- The **Fieldcrest Ln properties** specifically show ECFs of 0.852, 1.004, 1.024, and 1.252 — wide variation even on the same street

### ECF Per Individual Property (UNF) — 2026 Data

| Parcel | Address | Sale Price | Sale Date | ECF |
|--------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| L-12-12-315-027 | 3984 Palisades Blvd | $440,000 | 05/23/2023 | 0.875 |
| L-12-12-315-029 | 3960 Palisades Blvd | $400,000 | 08/04/2023 | 1.123 |

| L-12-12-435-082 | 3899 Century Ct | $462,500 | 02/20/2024 | 1.032 |

### What the ECF Means for 3543 Fieldcrest Ln

Your 2026 assessment implies a True Cash Value of **$506,854** (SEV $253,427 × 2). Applying the township's own ECF data:

- Using the **2026 average ECF of 1.016**: $506,854 × 1.016 = $514,964 — but this is meaningless because no home in the subdivision has ever sold for more than $470,000
- Using the **Fieldcrest Ln ECF of 0.856** (3578 Fieldcrest Ln, the closest comparable): $506,854 × 0.856 = **$433,867** — much closer to actual market evidence
- The **Fieldcrest Ln-specific ECFs** show that 3578 Fieldcrest Ln has an ECF of **0.856** (cost approach overvalues by 14.4%), while 3781 Fieldcrest Ln has an ECF of **1.082**

**The bottom line:** Regardless of which ECF you apply, the comparable sales data (Section 2) is the strongest evidence. Your implied TCV of $506,854 exceeds **every single sale** in the subdivision and is **$61,054 above** the Fieldcrest Ln average of $445,800.

## 2. Comparable Sales Analysis

### Direct Subdivision Comparables — Fieldcrest Ln Sales

These are the most directly comparable sales to 3543 Fieldcrest Ln, all on the same street:

| # | Address | Sale Price | Date | Terms | vs $506,854 TCV |
|---|---------|-----------|------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | 3781 Fieldcrest Ln | **$430,000** | Jul 23, 2024 | Arm's Length | **-$76,854 (15.2%)** |
| 2 | 3793 Fieldcrest Ln | **$455,000** | Jun 1, 2023 | Arm's Length | **-$51,854 (10.2%)** |
| 3 | 3578 Fieldcrest Ln | **$440,000** | Aug 31, 2023 | Arm's Length | **-$66,854 (13.2%)** |
| 4 | 3838 Fieldcrest Ln | **$434,000** | Apr 20, 2022 | Arm's Length | **-$72,854 (14.4%)** |
| 5 | 3745 Fieldcrest Ln | **$470,000** | Jun 14, 2022 | Arm's Length | **-$36,854 (7.3%)** |
| 6 | 3533 Fieldcrest Ln† | **$350,000** | Feb 21, 2025 | 21-NOT USED/OTHER | **-$156,854 (30.9%)** |

**† 3533 Fieldcrest Ln** was classified as "21-NOT USED/OTHER" by the township, suggesting it may not be an arm's-length transaction. However, if it was a legitimate sale, it represents the lowest price on Fieldcrest Ln and could support a lower valuation.

**Fieldcrest Ln Arm's-Length Statistics (excluding 3533):**
- **Average:** $445,800 (assessment is **$61,054 above average**)
- **Median:** $440,000 (assessment is **$66,854 above median**)
- **Range:** $430,000–$470,000
- **Most recent arm's-length sale:** $430,000 (3781 Fieldcrest Ln, Jul 2024)
- **All 5 arm's-length sales** are below the implied TCV of $506,854 — the assessment exceeds **100% of Fieldcrest Ln sales**

**Key finding:** No arm's-length sale in University Palisades has **ever** exceeded $470,000. The 2026 assessment for 3543 Fieldcrest Ln implies a TCV of **$506,854** — which is **$36,854 (7.9%) higher** than the most expensive home ever sold in the entire subdivision. The assessment is higher than **100% of all recorded sales**.

## 3. Land Value Analysis

The township's land analysis shows how land values in UNF have evolved:

| Year | Prior Land Value | Adjustment Factor | Current Land Value |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 2024 | $72,500 | 1.1594 (+15.9%) | $84,100 |
| 2025 | $84,100 | 1.0637 (+6.4%) | $89,500 |
| 2026 | $89,500 | 1.0280 (+2.8%) | $92,000 |

**Total land value increase: 26.9% over 3 years** ($72,500 → $92,000)

The land adjustment factor has been **declining sharply** — from 15.9% in 2024 to just 2.8% in 2026 — indicating the assessor recognizes that land value appreciation is slowing significantly.

### Land Residual Analysis (What the Market Says Land Is Worth)

The township calculates "land residual" by subtracting building value from sale price. For UNF sales in the 2026 study:

| Address | Sale Price | Land Residual | Land Value 2025 | Ratio LV/SP |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 3984 Palisades Blvd | $440,000 | $75,229 | $89,500 | 0.20 |
| 3972 Palisades Blvd | $430,000 | $188,941 | $89,500 | 0.21 |
| 3960 Palisades Blvd | $400,000 | $147,244 | $89,500 | 0.22 |
| 3781 Fieldcrest Ln | $430,000 | $140,980 | $89,500 | 0.21 |
| 3793 Fieldcrest Ln | $455,000 | $130,027 | $89,500 | 0.20 |
| 3578 Fieldcrest Ln | $440,000 | $68,177 | $89,500 | 0.20 |
| 3847 Palisades Blvd | $454,000 | $153,895 | $89,500 | 0.20 |
| 3899 Century Ct | $462,500 | $156,393 | $89,500 | 0.19 |

The wide variation in land residuals ($68,177 to $188,941) underscores the difficulty of the cost approach for this subdivision. The assigned land value of $92,000 (2026) represents approximately 20-22% of typical sale prices.

## 4. Year-Over-Year Assessment Trend

The township's data across three years reveals important patterns for University Palisades:

### Sales Study Coverage for UNF

| Year | # of UNF Sales in Study | Sales Date Range |
|------|------------------------|------------------|
| 2024 | 13 | 2021-2023 sales |
| 2025 | 14 | 2022-2024 sales |
| 2026 | 9 (8 arm's-length + 1 non-arm's-length) | 2023-2025 sales |

The number of sales in the study has been **declining** — from 13 in 2024 to 9 in 2026. Fewer comparable sales means less market evidence supporting the assessments, which can work in your favor during an appeal.

### ECF Summary Trend

| Year | UNF in ECF Summary? | Ave. ECF |
|------|---------------------|----------|
| 2024 | **No** — not included | N/A |
| 2025 | Yes | 0.974 |
| 2026 | Yes | 1.016 |

**Notable:** UNF was not included in the 2024 ECF summaries at all, making it impossible to verify the township's cost-approach calibration for that year. The ECF has risen from 0.974 to 1.016, suggesting the township has been adjusting its cost approach upward.

## 5. Specific Analysis for 3543 Fieldcrest Ln

### Your 2026 Assessment

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **2026 SEV (State Equalized Value)** | **$253,427** |
| **2026 Assessed Value** | **$253,427** |
| **2026 Taxable Value** | **$201,370** |
| **Implied True Cash Value (SEV × 2)** | **$506,854** |

### Assessment vs. Market Reality

| Comparison | Amount | Difference |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Implied TCV | $506,854 | — |
| Highest sale ever in UNF (3745 Fieldcrest Ln) | $470,000 | **Over-assessed by $36,854 (7.9%)** |
| Fieldcrest Ln average (5 arm's-length sales) | $445,800 | **Over-assessed by $61,054 (13.7%)** |
| Fieldcrest Ln median | $440,000 | **Over-assessed by $66,854 (15.2%)** |
| Most recent Fieldcrest sale (Jul 2024) | $430,000 | **Over-assessed by $76,854 (17.9%)** |
| Full subdivision average (21 sales) | $416,452 | **Over-assessed by $90,402 (21.7%)** |

**Your assessment implies a TCV higher than 100% of all arm's-length sales in the entire University Palisades subdivision.** This is a clear case of over-assessment.

### Recommended Value

Based on the comparable sales evidence:

| Scenario | Recommended TCV | Recommended SEV | Reduction from Current SEV |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Conservative** (Fieldcrest Ln average) | $445,800 | $222,900 | **$30,527** |
| **Moderate** (Fieldcrest Ln median) | $440,000 | $220,000 | **$33,427** |
| **Market-based** (most recent Fieldcrest sale) | $430,000 | $215,000 | **$38,427** |

### Best Comparables for 3543 Fieldcrest Ln

The strongest comparables are other Fieldcrest Ln homes, listed by relevance:

| Rank | Address | Sale Price | Date | Why It's Comparable |
|------|---------|-----------|------|---------------------|
| 1 | 3578 Fieldcrest Ln | $440,000 | Aug 31, 2023 | Closest address, same street section |
| 2 | 3533 Fieldcrest Ln† | $350,000 | Feb 21, 2025 | Immediate neighbor — but non-arm's-length |
| 3 | 3781 Fieldcrest Ln | $430,000 | Jul 23, 2024 | Most recent arm's-length Fieldcrest sale |
| 4 | 3793 Fieldcrest Ln | $455,000 | Jun 1, 2023 | Same street, arm's-length |
| 5 | 3838 Fieldcrest Ln | $434,000 | Apr 20, 2022 | Same street, arm's-length |

**† The 3533 Fieldcrest Ln sale** at $350,000 (Feb 2025) is your immediate neighbor. While classified as "21-NOT USED/OTHER" by the township (suggesting it may not be arm's-length), if you can demonstrate it was a legitimate market transaction, it would be powerful evidence of a lower market value. Investigate the circumstances of this sale.

## 6. Legal Framework

### Key Legal Standards

| Principle | Citation | Application |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| TCV = usual selling price | MCL 211.27(1) | Sales comps are the primary evidence |
| No presumption for assessor | *Alhi v Orion Twp*, 110 Mich App 764 | Burden does NOT favor assessor |
| Sales comparison most persuasive | *Meadowlanes v Holland*, 437 Mich 473 | For residential, comps trump cost approach |
| Independent duty to find correct value | *Great Lakes v Ecorse*, 227 Mich App 379 | Tribunal must independently evaluate |
| Arm's-length transaction standard | *Huron Ridge v Ypsilanti*, 275 Mich App 23 | Non-arm's-length sales are excluded |

### Proposal A Taxable Value

Your current taxable value is **$201,370**, which is already below the SEV of $253,427. Even if the assessed value is reduced to $222,900 (recommended conservative SEV), it would still be above the taxable value. However, the reduction still benefits you by:
1. Constraining future taxable value growth (TV grows from the lower base)
2. Establishing a lower baseline if the property is transferred (TV resets to SEV upon sale)
3. Demonstrating a pattern for future appeals
4. If the SEV is reduced below the taxable value ($201,370), your taxes would decrease immediately

## 8. Recommended Action Items

### Before March 10, 2026:

1. **Pull your property record card** from BSA Online (bsaonline.com/?uid=193) using your parcel number. Verify all physical characteristics (sq ft, beds, baths, lot size, condition) are correct. Any errors (overstated square footage, extra features you don't have) strengthen your case.

2. **Your key argument:** Your implied TCV of **$506,854** exceeds every single arm's-length sale in University Palisades. The five Fieldcrest Ln comparables average $445,800. Request a reduction to an SEV of **$215,000–$222,900** (TCV $430,000–$445,800).

3. **Investigate the 3533 Fieldcrest Ln sale** ($350,000, Feb 2025). This is your immediate neighbor. If this was a legitimate market transaction, it could significantly support your appeal.

4. **Request the assessor's sales study** used to value your specific property (you have this right under Michigan law).

5. **Complete Form L-4035** and submit with:
   - This comparable sales analysis
   - The ECF data from the township's own documents
   - Any property-specific issues (needed repairs, functional obsolescence)
   - Professional appraisal if available ($300-$500)

6. **Submit by March 10, 2026 at 5:00 PM**
   - In person at 6201 W. Michigan Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48108
   - By mail (certified, return receipt): same address
   - Or call 734-822-3115 to schedule a hearing appointment

7. **If Board of Review denies**: File with Michigan Tax Tribunal by July 31, 2026
