## Meadows of Arbor Ridge (AR-4), Pittsfield Township
### Based on Township Assessment Data: 2024, 2025, 2026

**Prepared: February 18, 2026**
**Appeal Deadline: March 10, 2026 at 5:00 PM**

## Executive Summary

Analysis of **three years of Pittsfield Township assessment data** (2024-2026) — including the Residential Sales Analysis, ECF Analysis, and Land Analysis — conclusively demonstrates that the 2026 assessments for homes in the Meadows of Arbor Ridge subdivision (AR-4) overstate market value. The township's own Economic Condition Factor (ECF) of **0.802** for AR-4 means the assessor acknowledges that cost-approach values exceed actual sale prices by approximately **20%**. No home in this subdivision has ever resold for the True Cash Values implied by many 2026 assessments.

**For 4806 Paulina Dr specifically:**
- 2026 SEV: **$242,732** → Implied TCV: **$485,464**
- Taxable Value: **$213,794**
- The two best direct comparables (same street, same builder): **$447,000** and **$450,000**
- Recommended TCV: **$450,000–$465,000** (SEV: $225,000–$232,500)
- Potential reduction: **$10,232–$17,732** in assessed value

## 1. The Township's Own ECF Data Proves Over-Assessment

The **Economic Condition Factor (ECF)** is the township's own metric comparing actual arm's-length sale prices to cost-approach valuations. An ECF below 1.0 means the cost approach *overvalues* properties compared to what they actually sell for.

### AR-4 ECF Trend (3-Year)

| Year | Ave. ECF | What It Means |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **2024** | **0.744** | Cost values exceed market by **25.6%** |
| **2025** | **0.790** | Cost values exceed market by **21.0%** |
| **2026** | **0.802** | Cost values exceed market by **19.8%** |

This is a **persistent, documented pattern** — not a one-year anomaly. The township's own data confirms that cost-approach valuations for AR-4 consistently overshoot actual market prices by 20-26%.

### ECF Per Individual Property (AR-4)

| Parcel | Address | Sale Price | 2024 ECF | 2025 ECF | 2026 ECF |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| L-12-13-311-036 | 4807 Paulina Dr | $450,000 | -- | 0.764 | 0.766 |
| L-12-13-311-058 | 4918 Paulina Dr | $447,000 | 0.804 | 0.803 | -- |
| L-12-13-311-031 | 4711 Paulina Dr | $500,000 | -- | 0.797 | 0.800 |
| L-12-13-311-063 | 4782 Paulina Dr | $452,000 | 0.807 | 0.806 | -- |
| L-12-13-311-057 | 4930 Paulina Dr | $365,424 | 0.707 | -- | -- |
| L-12-13-310-027 | 4610 Lilac Lane | $465,000 | -- | 0.819 | 0.822 |
| L-12-13-311-050 | 4324 Christina Ct | $499,900 | 0.643 | 0.815 | 0.818 |
| L-12-13-311-043 | 4321 Christina Ct | $430,000 | 0.724 | 0.723 | -- |
| L-12-13-310-024 | 4470 Connor Dr | $481,000 | 0.799 | 0.792 | -- |
| L-12-13-311-052 | 4458 Christina Dr | $420,000 | 0.724 | -- | -- |

**Every single ECF value is below 1.0.** The lowest was 0.643 (4324 Christina Ct in 2024), meaning the cost approach overvalued that property by 35.7% compared to its actual sale price.

### What the ECF Means for 4806 Paulina Dr

If the cost approach produces the 2026 assessment, and the ECF for this area is 0.802, then the market-adjusted value should be approximately:

- Cost-based TCV × ECF = Market TCV
- $485,464 × 0.802 = **$389,242**

This suggests the assessment may overstate market value by as much as **$96,222** (or the SEV overstates by ~$48,111). Even using a more conservative adjustment, the ECF clearly supports a TCV well below $485,464.

## 2. Comparable Sales Analysis

### Direct Subdivision Comparables (AR-4)

These are the only arm's-length sales ever recorded in the Meadows of Arbor Ridge:

| # | Address | Sale Price | Date | vs $485,464 TCV |
|---|---------|-----------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | 4807 Paulina Dr* | **$450,000** | Jul 19, 2023 | **-$35,464 (7.3%)** |
| 2 | 4918 Paulina Dr | **$447,000** | Mar 28, 2023 | **-$38,464 (7.9%)** |
| 3 | 4711 Paulina Dr | $500,000 | May 31, 2023 | +$14,536 |
| 4 | 4782 Paulina Dr | $452,000 | Oct 13, 2022 | -$33,464 |
| 5 | 4610 Lilac Lane | $465,000 | Aug 18, 2023 | -$20,464 |
| 6 | 4617 Lilac Lane | $452,000 | Jun 11, 2024 | -$33,464 |
| 7 | 4324 Christina Ct | $499,900 | Aug 11, 2023 | +$14,436 |
| 8 | 4321 Christina Ct | $430,000 | May 6, 2022 | -$55,464 |
| 9 | 4470 Connor Dr | $481,000 | May 25, 2022 | -$4,464 |
| 10 | 4458 Christina Dr | $420,000 | Jan 27, 2022 | -$65,464 |
| 11 | 4930 Paulina Dr | $365,424 | Jul 9, 2021 | -$120,040 |

**\* 4807 Paulina Dr is directly across the street from 4806 Paulina Dr**

**Statistics:**
- **Average:** $459,690 (assessment is **$25,774 above average**)
- **Median:** $452,000 (assessment is **$33,464 above median**)
- **Only 2 of 11 sales** (18%) exceeded $485,464
- The assessment implies a TCV **higher than 82% of all sales in the subdivision**

### The Most Compelling Comparable: 4807 Paulina Dr

The sale of 4807 Paulina Dr is the single strongest piece of evidence:

- **Location:** Directly across the street from 4806 Paulina Dr
- **Builder:** Same builder (Lombardo Homes)
- **Era:** Same construction period (~2018-2019)
- **Sale Price:** $450,000 (July 19, 2023)
- **2024 Township Appraisal:** $438,422
- **ECF:** 0.766 (2026), meaning cost approach overvalued by 23.4%

The subject's assessment implies a TCV **$35,464 higher** than its most directly comparable neighbor. There is no objective basis for this discrepancy between essentially identical properties.

### Adjacent Subdivision Sales (2023-2025)

The surrounding Arbor Ridge subdivisions share the same location, school district, and township:

**AR-1 (Arbor Ridge - older, built 1995-1997):**

| Address | Sale Price | Date | 2026 Appraisal |
|---------|-----------|------|----------------|
| 4562 Christina Dr | $427,000 | Nov 25, 2024 | $389,440 |
| 4936 Matthew Ct | $390,000 | Oct 31, 2024 | $395,088 |
| 4579 Connor Ct | $386,000 | Feb 7, 2024 | $413,397 |

**AR-2 (Woodlands of Arbor Ridge - built 2011-2017):**

| Address | Sale Price | Date | 2026 Appraisal |
|---------|-----------|------|----------------|
| 4336 Cloverlane Dr | $455,000 | Nov 15, 2024 | $398,249 |
| 4236 Cloverlane Dr | $410,000 | May 3, 2023 | $437,059 |
| 4249 Cloverlane Dr | $430,000 | Jun 1, 2023 | $424,507 |

**AR-3 (Arbor Ridge Crossing - newer, larger homes):**

| Address | Sale Price | Date | 2026 Appraisal |
|---------|-----------|------|----------------|
| 4264 Lilac Lane | $630,000 | Jun 14, 2024 | $591,356 |
| 4182 Montith Dr | $602,250 | Dec 30, 2024 | $553,378 |

Note: AR-3 homes are significantly larger (3,000+ sq ft) and more expensive. They represent the *upper boundary* of values in the Arbor Ridge complex, not comparable properties to typical Paulina Dr homes.

## 3. Land Value Analysis

The township's land analysis shows how land values in AR-4 have evolved:

| Year | Prior Land Value | Adjustment Factor | Current Land Value |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 2024 | $84,300 | 1.0648 (+6.5%) | $89,800 |
| 2025 | $89,800 | 1.0734 (+7.3%) | $96,400 |
| 2026 | $96,400 | 1.0290 (+2.9%) | $99,200 |

**Total land value increase: 17.7% over 3 years** ($84,300 → $99,200)

For comparison, the 2026 land adjustment factor of 1.0290 is the **lowest in three years**, suggesting the assessor recognizes that the rapid land value appreciation is slowing. Yet the overall assessments continue to rise.

### Land Residual Analysis (What the Market Says Land Is Worth)

The township calculates "land residual" by subtracting building value from sale price. For AR-4 sales:

| Address | Sale Price | Land Residual | % of Sale |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| 4617 Lilac Lane | $452,000 | $177,270 | 39.2% |
| 4610 Lilac Lane | $465,000 | $129,681 | 27.9% |
| 4711 Paulina Dr | $500,000 | $123,246 | 24.6% |
| 4807 Paulina Dr | $450,000 | $105,669 | 23.5% |
| 4324 Christina Ct | $499,900 | $131,749 | 26.4% |

The wide variation in land residuals (23.5% to 39.2%) underscores the difficulty of the cost approach for this subdivision and further supports reliance on the sales-comparison method.

## 4. Year-Over-Year Assessment Trend

The township's data across three years reveals an important pattern:

### Sales Study Coverage for AR-4

| Year | # of AR-4 Sales in Study | Sales Used |
|------|-------------------------|------------|
| 2024 | 7 | 2021-2023 sales |
| 2025 | 8 | 2022-2023 sales |
| 2026 | 0* | (AR-4 dropped from sales analysis) |

**\*Critical finding:** The 2026 Residential Sales Analysis **does not include any AR-4 properties**. The township appears to have dropped the older 2022-2023 sales from the study but has no newer sales to replace them. Yet assessments continue to increase. This raises the question: **what market evidence supports the 2026 AR-4 assessments?**

## 5. Broader Market Context

### Pittsfield Township Market Ceiling

Sales from comparable Pittsfield Township neighborhoods in the 48197 zip code (2024-2025) consistently show a ceiling for homes in the 2,000-2,600 sq ft range:

| Address | Sale Price | Date | Sq Ft | Notes |
|---------|-----------|------|-------|-------|
| 5957 Cottonwood Dr | $397,501 | Apr 2025 | 2,099 | Ashford Village, AA Schools |
| 5129 Blue Spruce Dr | $422,500 | Sep 2025 | 3,276 | **Larger** home sold for **less** |
| 8045 Creek Bend Dr | $465,500 | Jun 2025 | 2,915 | Brick colonial, larger |
| 4265 Cloverlane Dr | $465,000 | Apr 2025 | 1,960 | Woodlands of AR |
| 4482 Christina Dr | $380,000 | May 2025 | 1,603 | Arbor Ridge |

### Zillow Zestimate Caveat

Zillow's automated Zestimate for 4806 Paulina is approximately $548,200. While this might be cited by the assessor, Zestimates:
- Are algorithmic estimates with no legal standing
- Are not accepted as evidence of market value under Michigan law
- Frequently overstate values for newer subdivisions with limited sales history
- Do not account for subdivision-specific conditions (ECF < 1.0)

**Actual arm's-length sales are the proper measure** of true cash value under MCL 211.27(1).

## 6. Legal Framework

### Key Legal Standards

| Principle | Citation | Application |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| TCV = usual selling price | MCL 211.27(1) | Sales comps are the primary evidence |
| No presumption for assessor | *Alhi v Orion Twp*, 110 Mich App 764 | Burden does NOT favor assessor |
| Sales comparison most persuasive | *Meadowlanes v Holland*, 437 Mich 473 | For residential, comps trump cost approach |
| Independent duty to find correct value | *Great Lakes v Ecorse*, 227 Mich App 379 | Tribunal must independently evaluate |
| Arm's-length transaction standard | *Huron Ridge v Ypsilanti*, 275 Mich App 23 | Non-arm's-length sales are excluded |

### Proposal A Taxable Value

Even if the assessed value is reduced but remains above the taxable value ($213,794), the reduction still benefits the homeowner by:
1. Constraining future taxable value growth (TV grows from the lower base)
2. Establishing a lower baseline for property transfer adjustments
3. Demonstrating a pattern for future appeals
